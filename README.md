## Project Overview

The **Personalized News Aggregator** is an AI-driven application designed to curate personalized news feeds. It leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to fetch, summarize, and analyze news articles based on user-defined keywords. The application provides a unique experience by tailoring content to user preferences, making it a useful tool for staying informed on topics of interest.

## Features

- **Automated News Fetching**: Retrieves the latest news articles from NewsAPI based on specified keywords.
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of articles using a transformer-based model.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Provides sentiment scores to indicate the emotional tone of the articles.
- **Personalized Content**: Customizes the news feed according to user-defined interests.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The application uses the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to gather news articles. Users can specify keywords that reflect their areas of interest, and the application retrieves relevant articles.

### Text Summarization

A pre-trained transformer model from the `transformers` library is used to summarize the articles. The model condenses the main points of each article into a brief summary, making it easier for users to grasp the essential information quickly.

### Sentiment Analysis

The `TextBlob` library is employed for sentiment analysis. It assigns a polarity score to each summary, ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive), indicating the overall sentiment of the article.

### Personalization

The application personalizes the news feed by filtering and presenting articles based on user-defined keywords. This customization ensures that users receive content that aligns with their interests.

### Data Storage

The summarized articles, along with their sentiment scores and other metadata, are stored in a pandas DataFrame. The data can be exported to a CSV file for further analysis or sharing.
